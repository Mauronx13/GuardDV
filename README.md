GuardDV is a portable system able to warn potential victims and the corresponding law enforcement organizations about the physical proximity of an aggressor who has been ordered to stay away. Existing products allow for tracking offenders using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) technology alone. These systems provide the capability to alert authorities if an offender enters a particular area, such as a victimâ€™s house or office, but they do little to protect a victim while she is mobile.

## TODO
 * [ ] Add GPS Functionality
 * [ ] Perform Phone Call
